"All names and events in the game are fictional, any coincidence with real people and events is pure coincidence. "
"This happened to my best friend, when we were studying in our INHA University in Tashkent"
"Hello, I will tell you one story, about one quite unusual person."
"It all started like this"
<<Act @ Morphius, boy2, right, 0.40, blue>>
Morphius: "Hey, what are you doing get up, the mountains are already visible!"
"I barely barely opened my eyes, after a sleepless night at the books on medicinal herbs, I felt mildly speaking, badly"
"My name is August, I am a 3rd year medical student, now we are going to the mountains to study medicinal herbs in their natural growing area"
<<Act @ August, transparet , left, 0.40, green>>
August: "Да, да, встаю уже"

"In our conversation climbed, our Miss Active Uni Rene"
"From the very beginning of her studies, she was the most active girl of the uni for whom no one could keep up, so also intelligent and beautiful"
Morphius: Oh yeah
<<Hide @ Rene>>

Morphius: Zod, look at the window
<<Act @ Zod, boy1, left, 0.40, black>>

"Zod, is one of the the cleverest guys of our University, he always gets first place in the tests. "

"I went to the plant and carefully examined it."

"Yarrow belongs to the genus Achillea, family Astrovyh (Compository). And its exact species name - yarrow (Achillea millefolia). The plant got its name because of the shape of the leaves. In fact, of course, the yarrow leaves much less than a thousand, but From the side, it seems that each leaf of a grass consists of many small sections. The leaves of the plant are strongly elongated. Their length is about 15 cm and the width is no more than 3 cm. On the reverse side of the leaf there are numerous oil glands.. The stalk is of medium size, about half a meter in height, although some specimens can reach a height of more than a meter. The inflorescence consists of many small white or pink flowers, grouped in baskets. In the upper part of the flowers form the surface of the inflorescence in the form of a shield. Growing grass also exudes a characteristic odor. Flowers are pollinated by insects. Seeds are small, about 1.5-2 mm in length. The plant propagates both with the help of seeds and in a vegetative way, with the help of roots. "
"In addition to the official name, the popular names of the plant are also known - cut-grass, cutter, serporez, chyhotochnaya grass, porridge, whitehead, tenacious grass, guljavitsa, krovi. Most of these names are very eloquent and indicates that the plant was widely used to treat wounds For medicinal purposes, not only the common yarrow is used, but also other types of yarrow - Asian and bristly. "
August: "Ha!, So I can use it to heal my leg a little!"
<<set $find to true>>
"Tearing off some leaves from the yarrow, I treated my wound and it became much easier for me"

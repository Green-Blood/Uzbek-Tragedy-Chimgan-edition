This is project of TEAM-14. Unfortunately, the size of final product is more than that eclass allows to submit
We have done our game on Unity. And our game supports multiple platforms (UNIX, Microsoft,MacOS and android).
So, every platform will need additional space, which eclass does not allow.

Additional info: 
1. If game is not working, DB should be included in game_data(Windows platform) or in /contents(MacOs)
2. Running on MacOS: chmod a+x UzbekTragedy.app/Contents/MacOS/*
3. Resolution of game is 1280x1024(for convinience)
